1. The test is is attempting to make an api request with a  query parameter for a search phrase;

	https://api.com/v1/people?searchPhrase=Andrew
	
	the test then runs a get request on the url above.
	
	then tries to retireve the id of the result without a key search but by using indexing
	
	it then deletes the the id associated to the searchPrase get request result.
	
	and expects a no conent response 204 as a status code to the delete request
	
	it then creates a get request to people andpoint with the id of Andrew
	
	and expects a not found 404 which suggest the user with that id does not exist
	
	
2. this is a static test assuming andrew allways exists or gets added before the test is run

the query to find the id key is using indexing making assumption of the return structure

tests for different api methods are strung together


3. parameterize data  , setup data before test is run in a pre requisite methods

break up different requuest into smaller units to test functionality and create a sequential flow to determine where the api request method could contain a bug

dont make assumptions of the response schema more dynamic
